help me create a c4/semantic web/mermaid plantuml deployment  diagram 
for a self service cognito enabled, smart agent server hosting, 
with many different deployment options ranging from t2-small to any larger size.
using terraform, aws, ec2, alb,diagram

		   godaddy -> ns api.swarms.ai ->

	   AMI : components/machine_image/ubuntu-fastapi.pkr.hcl

	   swarms -> ec2, user data
    	  github clone branch run api/install.sh, swarms user, app/boot.sh as swarms user (virtual env)
	      instance profile (our server, customer server) ->
		  todo :read access to specific ssm secrets -> openai key
		   servers tagged as user X can access secrets tagged Y.
		   outgoing ip address : (can talk to other servers) (allow certain ip ranges)
		  , nginx, systemd (isolate user process, write access to home), uvicorn -> swarms 4 processes fast api.
	   
	   githubactions -> oidc connection -> aws -> ssm document -> update your part of the server.
	   githubactions -> oidc connection -> aws -> ssm document -> terraform -> create new clusters 

shared hosted aws account :
   profiles for each customer, 
	tags for customer resources
    which api calls they can use
    tags for cost tracking 
	custom vpc, subsets network resources.
	
	on servers, the agents will have own aws role/profiles (like lamda)
    either each customer/agent gets own unix user, homedir, storage, email , backup.
    containerization, k8s, docker.

### Key Components:
1. **Accounts/Swarms**: Represents the main framework for your smart agent server.
2. **Environments**: Contains different environments such as `dev` in `us-east-1`.
3. **EC2 Instance**: Details the EC2 setup, including user data and necessary components (Nginx, Systemd, Uvicorn).
4. **GitHub Actions**: Integrates CI/CD using OIDC, SSM, and Terraform.
5. **Shared Hosted AWS Account**: Manages profiles, tags, and VPC configurations for customer resources.

You can copy this code into a PlantUML tool to visualize the deployment diagram.
### Explanation:
- **Packages and Rectangles**: The diagram encapsulates components like Route 53, ALB, and Auto Scaling Group within a structured format.
- **Interactions**: Arrows show the relationships and interactions among components, such as the CNAME setup with Route 53 and the EC2 instances launching user data scripts.
- **GitHub Actions**: Represents automation activities and connections to AWS services.
- **Shared AWS Account**: Displays customer management and tagging for resources.

This structure captures your specifications for the deployment of a self-service Cognito-enabled smart agent server using Terraform and AWS components effectively. Adjust as necessary for your specific documentation needs!```

### Explanation:
- The main structure includes the accounts, environments, EC2 instances, GitHub Actions, and shared AWS resources.
- The individual components and their interactions are represented using rectangles for entities and arrows for relationships.
- Customize further by adding details and refining the relationships based on your specific needs.```

To manage a shared hosted AWS account for multiple customers with the requirements you've laid out, you can consider the following architecture:

### AWS Account Structure:
1. **Profiles**: Utilize IAM roles and users for each customer. Create separate profiles in the AWS CLI for easy access.
   
2. **Resource Tagging**: Implement a consistent tagging strategy for all resources (e.g., `CustomerName`, `Project`, `Environment`, `CostCenter`) to facilitate cost management and resource identification.
   
3. **API Call Restrictions**: Use IAM policies to specify which API calls each customer's role can perform based on their needs.

4. **Cost Tracking**: Leverage AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, filtering by tags to track costs per customer.

5. **Networking**: Set up custom VPCs for customers if isolation is required. Use subnets and security groups to segment resources.

### Server and Agent Management:
1. **AWS Roles for Agents**: Each agent (server) should have an IAM role assigned that grants necessary permissions. If using Lambda, this can be done via execution roles.

2. **Unix User Management**: Depending on your requirements:
   - One option is to create a Unix user for each customer/agent.
   - Assign unique home directories, storage solutions (e.g., EBS, S3), and ensure proper permissions.
   
3. **Containerization**: Use Docker and Kubernetes (EKS) to manage applications. This allows for easier resource allocation and isolation between different customers.

4. **Email & Backup**: Consider using Amazon SES for email needs and AWS Backup/CloudFormation for automated backups of customer data.

### Best Practices:
- **Security**: Regularly audit IAM roles and policies for least privilege access.
- **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch for logging and monitoring resource utilization.
- **Cost Management**: Use AWS Cost Allocation Reports to analyze customer costs effectively.

This architecture ensures streamlined operations, cost tracking, and enhanced security across customer resources in a shared AWS account.    



### Repo Structure Overview

- **Root Directory**: The main container of your Terraform project (`terraform-template/`).
  
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and documentation for the project, helping users understand its purpose and how to use it.

- **Environments**: Contains specific configurations for different environments (e.g., development, staging).
  - **swarms-aws-agent-api**: An example service with various setups.
    - **dev/us-east-1**: The development environment tailored for the US East (N. Virginia) region.

- **Modules**: Encapsulates reusable Terraform code to ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
  - **swarms**: A collection of Terraform modules related to the swarm infrastructure.

### Components Explained

- **DNS Management**:
  - Using GoDaddy for domain management and AWS Route 53 for DNS routing (e.g., `api.swarms.ai`).

- **Application Layer**:
  - Includes an Application Load Balancer directing traffic to an Auto Scaling Group, which manages instances defined by a launch template.

- **Instance Management**:
  - AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) created using Packer (e.g., `ubuntu-fastapi.pkr.hcl`).

- **Settings for EC2 Instances**:
  - User data scripts to set up necessary configurations, such as cloning from GitHub and running scripts as the `swarms` user to set up the FastAPI application.

- **Access Management**:
  - IAM roles and instance profiles are created to manage permissions. SSM (AWS Systems Manager) secrets are tagged, allowing specific servers to access configurations, like OpenAI keys.

- **Networking**:
  - Outbound traffic settings defined to control which IP ranges can communicate with the infrastructure.

- **Application Deployment**:
  - Utilizes Nginx and Systemd to manage FastAPI processes, ensuring multiple instances run smoothly.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Implements OIDC connections to AWS for secure deployments and updates using GitHub Actions.
- SSM documents are utilized for executing specific management tasks, like creating new clusters and updating configurations seamlessly.

This structure facilitates a modular, maintainable, and automated approach to infrastructure as code using Terraform, alongside solid CI/CD practices.
