# To develop a recursive cloud system based on the provided project parameters, we can construct a recursive function that surfaces and enacts various cloud resources and configurations iteratively. Here's a basic example of how this might be structured in pseudo-code:


# ### Explanation:
# 1. **Recursive Function**: `swarm_terraform(level)` serves as the main function that sets up resources based on the current recursion depth.
# 2. **Setup Functions**: Helper functions are defined for local clusters, CI/CD, AWS accounts, secrets, and IAM.
# 3. **Level-Based Logic**: The creation of resources and configurations is determined based on the recursion level, allowing the system to build incrementally.
# 4. **Termination Condition**: The recursion stops at a defined `MAX_LEVEL` to prevent infinite execution.

# ### Steps to Execution:
# - Implement specific logic within each helper function as per your project needs.
# - Adjust the `MAX_LEVEL` variable based on how detailed or expansive you want the recursive processing to be.

# This structure provides a solid foundation for building out the cloud infrastructure recursively, driven by the initial parameters you've outlined.


# To express this concept in a modular Terraform-style pseudo-language, you may want to define a resource that captures the essence of your statement S while incorporating the probabilistic and self-referential properties of system G. Hereâ€™s a concise example:

# ```hcl
# resource "godel_dawkins_quine" "system_G" {
#   name        = "G"
#   probability = var.P
#   threshold   = var.M

#   statement {
#     content = "S can be proven in system G"
#     complexity = calculate_complexity(content) # define this function for complexity measure
#     proven_in_time_less_than_M = complexity < var.M
#   }

#   self_modifying {
#     enabled = true
#     modifications = ["update_probability", "redefine_threshold"]
#   }
# }

# variable "P" {
#   description = "Probability threshold"
#   type        = number
#   default     = 0.95
# }

# variable "M" {
#   description = "Maximum time for proof"
#   type        = number
#   default     = 100  # example limit on time
# }
# ```




# It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or you are looking for further clarification. Here's an extended Terraform module example that incorporates recursive processes and configurations for cloud resources based on your initial request:

# ```hcl
# terraform {
#   required_providers {
#     aws = {
#       source  = "hashicorp/aws"
#       version = "~> 3.0"
#     }
#   }
# }

# variable "max_levels" {
#   description = "Maximum level of recursion"
#   type        = number
#   default     = 3
# }

# resource "aws_iam_user" "swarm_user" {
#   count = var.max_levels

#   name = "swarm_user_${count.index}"

#   tags = {
#     Level = count.index
#   }
# }

# resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "swarm_secret" {
#   count = var.max_levels

#   name = "swarm_secret_${count.index}"

#   description = "Secret for level ${count.index}"
# }

# resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "swarm_user_pool" {
#   count = var.max_levels

#   name = "swarm_user_pool_${count.index}"
#   alias_attributes = ["email"]

#   lambda_config {
#     pre_sign_up = aws_lambda_function.pre_sign_up[count.index].arn
#   }
# }

# resource "aws_lambda_function" "pre_sign_up" {
#   count = var.max_levels

#   function_name = "pre_sign_up_${count.index}"
#   runtime       = "nodejs14.x"

#   handler = "index.handler"
#   source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("path_to_your_lambda_zip_${count.index}.zip")

#   role = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
# }

# resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_exec" {
#   name = "lambda_exec_role"
  
#   assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
#     Version = "2012-10-17"
#     Statement = [{
#       Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
#       Principal = {
#         Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
#       }
#       Effect = "Allow"
#       Sid = ""
#     }]
#   })
# }

# output "swarm_users" {
#   value = aws_iam_user.swarm_user[*].name
# }

# output "swarm_secrets" {
#   value = aws_secretsmanager_secret.swarm_secret[*].name
# }

# output "swarm_user_pools" {
#   value = aws_cognito_user_pool.swarm_user_pool[*].id
# }
# ```

# ### Key Components:

# - **Recursive Resource Creation**: The use of the `count` parameter simulates recursion by creating multiple instances of resources based on the specified `max_levels`.
  
# - **IAM Users and Secrets**: Creates IAM users and AWS secrets for each level.

# - **Cognito User Pools**: Sets up a user pool for authentication at each recursion depth.

# - **Outputs**: Outputs the created IAM users, secrets, and Cognito user pools, allowing you to track the resources created at each level.

# ### Execution:
# - Adjust `max_levels` as needed to control the depth of resource creation.
# - Ensure that the paths to any Lambda function code or specific policies are set correctly.

# This example captures the essence of a meta Terraform module while following the recursive and self-referential principles you've outlined. Let me know how you would like to expand or modify this!


# It seems you're looking for further examples or a continuation of the Terraform module design. Here's a more comprehensive modular approach that emphasizes recursion and the creation of various cloud resources, broken down into subtasks for clarity:

# ### Main Terraform Configuration

# ```hcl
# module "swarm_terraform" {
#   source        = "./modules/swarm" # Define the module source
#   level         = 1                  # Start at recursion level 1
#   max_levels    = var.max_levels     # Maximum recursion depth
#   aws_region    = var.aws_region      # AWS region variable
# }

# variable "max_levels" {
#   description = "Maximum depth for resource creation"
#   type        = number
#   default     = 3
# }

# variable "aws_region" {
#   description = "AWS region to deploy resources"
#   type        = string
#   default     = "us-east-1"
# }
# ```

# ### Module: `modules/swarm/main.tf`

# ```hcl
# resource "aws_iam_user" "swarm_user" {
#   count = var.level <= var.max_levels ? 1 : 0
  
#   name = "swarm_user_${var.level}"

#   tags = {
#     Level = var.level
#   }
# }

# resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "swarm_secret" {
#   count = var.level <= var.max_levels ? 1 : 0

#   name = "swarm_secret_${var.level}"
# }

# resource "aws_lambda_function" "pre_sign_up" {
#   count = var.level <= var.max_levels ? 1 : 0

#   function_name = "pre_sign_up_${var.level}"
#   runtime       = "nodejs14.x"
#   handler       = "index.handler"

#   # Assuming the source code is provided
#   source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("path_to_your_lambda_zip_${var.level}.zip")
#   role            = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
# }

# resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_exec" {
#   name = "lambda_exec_role"

#   assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
#     Version = "2012-10-17"
#     Statement = [{
#       Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
#       Principal = {
#         Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
#       }
#       Effect = "Allow"
#       Sid = ""
#     }]
#   })
# }

# # Recursive module call to create resources for the next level
# module "swarm_terraform_next" {
#   source        = "./main.tf"
#   level         = var.level + 1
#   max_levels    = var.max_levels
#   aws_region    = var.aws_region
#   depends_on    = [aws_iam_user.swarm_user, aws_secretsmanager_secret.swarm_secret, aws_lambda_function.pre_sign_up]
# }
# ```

# ### Explanation:

# 1. **Modular Structure**: This approach divides the resources into a module, making it reusable and expandable.
   
# 2. **Recursion Handling**: The module checks if the current `level` is less than or equal to `max_levels`. If it is, it creates the corresponding resources and calls itself for the next level.

# 3. **IAM User and Lambda Function**: Each recurred level creates new IAM users, Secrets Manager secrets, and Lambda functions, maintaining the recursion.

# 4. **Outputs**: Outputs can be included to retrieve created resource details at the end of processing, although they are not explicitly shown in this snippet.

# ### Execution Steps:
# - Ensure you have the appropriate IAM permissions and AWS configuration.
# - Adjust the `max_levels` variable as desired, and ensure the paths to any Lambda function source code are correctly defined.
# - Use `terraform apply` to trigger the recursion and monitor resource creation.

# This format should give you a robust foundation for developing a complex, recursive Terraform setup. If you need further adjustments or detailed explanations on specific elements, let me know!
